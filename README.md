This is the second project I did for my intro to web development class. This site is meant to be a website for selling special computer cases. I believe I created most of the images by slapping a texture from Adobe Fireworks on to some random computer case images. The info about each case is completely made up, but I tried to use my best judgment for realism at the time. The court case was totally fake and meant more as a laugh than anything. The site uses a little bit of javascript to show a slideshow on the home page and create a rollover effect for a couple of the images. The rollover works well, but the slideshow doesn't always seem to work correctly. I don't remember writing the code for this and it's possible I used code provided by the professor here in an incorrect way. The footer of the site is also positioned a little bit awkwardly so if I were to recreate the site, I would definitely fix that. I'd also use borders less to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
